**Churn Rate and Retention Rate**

1.	How was the overall churn / retention rate performance in the company?
2.	Is there any possibility to reach up to 50% revenue retention rate in the next 3 months?
3.	Is there a trade off that occurs when we increase the retention rate?

**Answer**

**1.	How was the overall churn / retention rate performance in the company?**

- If we average each elapsed month, we only retain 23% of the user retention.

- It’s a big problem that the company only 20’s% of the users retention, even in the initial purchase subscription.

- We have drop user churn in December 2010, but it’s because dataset is not even fully 30 days, so we only have partial information.

- In sep 2010, some of our users upgrade their subscription / purchase add ons.

- We can see that by looking at the increment from august-sept 2010.

- The increment peaked in Oct-Nov 2010.

- There’s drop on Jan 2010 to Feb 2010 cohort and so on

- The possible reason the explain this is because:

• Company reduce the marketing budget after Jan 2010 cohort
• There’s seasonality in Jan 2010 (after new year sales)

**Summary**

• Seasonal Factors: Winter Holidays, and New Year
• Marketing Efforts: Budget and Campaingn Creative
  If the problem is low marketing efforts (including low budget and bad campaign marketing), our recommendations just simply increase the budget or use marketing agency services (We have insufficient data to analyze which campaign creative is the best)

We’re interested to analyze the seasonal factors

**Seaonal Factors:**

• In UK, there are at least 2 possible long holiday seasons: winter and summer
• In Spring, we have Easter, May Day, and Mother Day as short holiday
• In Autumn, we have Halloween and Diwali
• Riding the wave, if competitors run seasonal campaign (e.g. 1.1 2.2 until 12.12), if our company can’t make it better, just follow the trend with additional uniqueness.

**Expected Future Revenue**

Given:
• Churn Rate = 76,34%
• Average Order Value = $20 (Assume)
• Margin = 80%
We can use CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) formula to estimate our expected revenue per user
CLV = (Average Order Value * Margin) / Churn rate
       = ($20 * 80%) / 76%
       = $21.05
We can expect single customer will gain revenue $21.05 until (in average) 1 month and 10 days ahead (Average Lifetime Value (1.3 month)

**2. Is there any possibility to reach up to 50% revenue retention rate in the next 3 months?**

•	It’s likely possible to reach up to 50% in short term if we look at big drop between initial month subscription and first month subscription and also with next following months.
•	Instead, we can use a good user retention strategy to prevent event higher customer churn is the next following months.
•	Technically, to retain existing in a short term we can use excellent customer service and offer discount to existing customer to keep them.
•	To increase revenue retention and customer retention we can offer them with discount strategy with winning products add ons (Payment integration and storage).
•	We can focus to improve Platinum user so overall revenue retention rate can be improved well.
• Remember, since the difference between each category add-ons and user type is not significant enough by visualization, we can also implement general “treatment” to all type of users.
•	Or, we can conduct deeper analysis to find another metrics, get more data, and level up the analysis (e.g. diagnostic analysis/predictive analysis)
•	It’s likely possible to achieve 50% revenue retention rate in the long run, however we can still improve it but we need to consider several things:
  **> Products**
  • After looking at the drop between initial purchase and first month subscription, there’s and indication that our product / values didn’t meet the user expectations.
  •	In order to improve revenue retention, in the long run we should improve company’s product and make another diverse product.
  • Make a ‘sustainable’ product solution. For example, our user wants to make ecommerce, then we can provide all integrated solutions e.g. Marketing / Ad solution, shipping control, ecommerce interface design, hosting/server, etc.
  • So user have no other choice but to use our products which are integrated with each other.

**> Price**
  • Probably, instead of the product, the problem is with our product’s prices. If the proce is not worth the value, then the user is more likely to churn.
  •	We can implement freemium pricing strategy, basic functionality is provided for free, but advanced features or higher usage limits require a paid subscription.
  • And also implement free-trial- period strategy, allow customers to try the software before committing to a paid subscription.

**3. Is there a trade off that occurs when we increase the retention rate?**

•	If the company wants to focus on short-term user retention rates, then there’s a trade-off that company will probably lose user growth opportunities. (in short-term company tried to increase revenue as fast and high as possible)
•	If a company wants to focus on long-term user growth, then there’s a trade-off that the company will not get much revenue in the short term. (in long-term, typically company will focus on retention and user growth)

**Cost Analysis**

Given information we have $65,000 marketing budget.
1.	How much CAC to acquire each user?
2.	Is it profitable to have CAC like this?
3.	What is overall best strategy for the company condition?

**Answer**
Given information we have $65,000 marketing budget.
1.	How much CAC to acquire each user? (Active Users 4,258)
• Since we have 4,258 active accounts, to acquire each account we need divide $65,000 / 4,258 = $15,26 CAC

2.	Is it profitable to have CAC like this?
•	Using this calculation
We can use CLV formula to estimate our expected revenue per user
CLV = (Average Order Value * Margin) / Churn Rate
       = ($20 * 80%) / 73%
       = $20,95
•	Our CAC is $15 and estimated average CLV is $20
•	We use rule thumb ratio CLV:CAC is 3:1, therefore our CLV is not good enough.
•	Company can’t conduct marketing campaign with high budget, because it will lead to revenue loss

3.	What is overall best strategy for the company condition?
•	Company can focus on short-term strategy to increase their revenue retention rate and CLV
•	Create typically cheap product & easy to launch product to boost short term revenue
•	E.g., Digital Templates or Themes for ecommerce store / Digital Guides or Courses
•	If the company succeed to increase CLV, they can slightly focus on long-term strategy (user growth)

**Further Analysis Recommendations**
•	Based on the data we analyzed, we found the data pattern is not clearly visible in the descriptive analysis, it’s probably because:
  > The data itself, bad sampling, need larger sample size, or it’s not the latest data
  > Level of analysis, we probably can leverage our insights through higher level of analysis (e.g. diagnostic / predictive)
